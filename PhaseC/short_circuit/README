Phase three HY340 compilers:
- Dimitrios Makrogiannis 4676
- Katerina Gyparaki 4621
- Kalliopi Samaritaki 5140


We have implemented all the long circuit version of the compiler.
The short circuit only lacks in for loops maybe.

option: 
  remove from comment line 133 of src/src/quad.cpp in order to have optimized jumps.

Runs in portokali with the following command (genrates quads.txt by itself):
- make clean 
- make 
./compiler inputfile outputfile[optional]
